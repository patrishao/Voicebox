Vociebox is social media platform made in pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP for everyone who wants to freely express their thoughts or worries. This website focuses on users who are going through a difficult period in their life, allowing them to share their feelings with other people online. 

Keeping problems to oneself isn’t always a good thing and if you keep bottling it up, it can be harmful. Having someone to talk to, no matter where they are in the world can bring comfort, warmth, and a sense of good support system for someone. If people are feeling lonely and in need of support or if they are unable to express their emotions or problems to the people present in waking life, the community of Voicebox is there for them.
